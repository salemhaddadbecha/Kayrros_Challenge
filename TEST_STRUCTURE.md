This test mocks one part of the pipeline: how we ingest data and expose it internally.

## Test Instructions

**Time Limit**: 4 hours

**What We're Looking For**:
This test is about demonstrating **engineering practices** and **production readiness**, not just functional code. We value:

1. **Architecture & Design Decisions**
   - Why did you structure the code this way?
   - What trade-offs did you make given the time constraint?
   - How would you scale this if needed?

2. **Documentation Quality**
   - A comprehensive README is worth more than extra features
   - Explain your choices, constraints, and trade-offs
   - If you ran out of time, state it clearly with what you'd do next

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Code quality and maintainability
   - Error handling and validation
   - Testing strategy (even if not fully implemented)
   - Deployment considerations

4. **Initiative & Problem Solving**
   - The specifications are deliberately vague
   - Show your ability to make informed decisions
   - Add features/improvements that make sense for production
   - Prioritize what matters most

**LLM Usage**:
- You are **encouraged** to use AI/LLM tools during this test
- **You MUST document your LLM usage**
